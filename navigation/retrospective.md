- 0.95/1 bc I tried many new things and learned a lot doing so

### RPG game tinkers
- I added an inventory
- I changed the movement

#### Future plans 
- robotics
- game dev
- maybe cybersecurity
- plan to work on more projects

#### Individual strengths and weaknesses
- good at coding
- collaborate well
<br>
- should be more creative
- be willing to try more unique solutions

#### Next Steps
- rewrite code to be more expandable
- know a lot more about js than before starting project, so we can make more complicated changes
- add minigames to obtain keys
 

- 0.92/1 bc I have a good plan of what to do in the future in both CS and the project


Total score: 4.68/5
