### 5 key things I did this trimester

- Created a lesson with jupyter notebooks
- Created an item that extended on base code
- Added an inventory to rpg gam
- I made the quiz check for correct answers in the RPG game.
- 0.95/1 bc I tried many new things and learned a lot doing so

### RPG game tinkers
- I added an inventory
- I changed the movement
- I added an item that disapears once interacted with and allows player to check if the item has been collected
- Edited the quiz to check for correct answer and reward the player if answered correctly
- 0.98/1 bc I made some unique tinkers that required a lot of changes to the game

#### Key points

- make quests a little more complex

- 0.88/1 we got 8 points of feedback, but most were from people in csse2

### Reflection and looking forward
- I was interested in Matthew's bathroom scanner, I thought it was cool how he managed to take the input from the card and then turn that into the time

#### Future plans 
- robotics
- game dev
- maybe cybersecurity
- plan to work on more projects

#### Individual strengths and weaknesses
- good at coding
- collaborate well
<br>
- should be more creative
- be willing to try more unique solutions

#### Next Steps
- rewrite code to be more expandable
- know a lot more about js than before starting project, so we can make more complicated changes
- add minigames to obtain keys
 

- 0.92/1 bc I have a good plan of what to do in the future in both CS and the project


Total score: 4.68/5 or 0.936/1
